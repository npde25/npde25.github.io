        <div class="text-content">
          On Wednesday, June 18, we plan to go for a walk through Edinburgh before heading towards the conference dinner venue. We will meet at <b>15:30 downstairs in JCMB</b>. The plan is to walk up Arthur's Seat for a view of the city, and then walk past Holyrood House Palace, go up the Royal Mile, and finally see Edinburgh Castle. Depending on how well we do on time, we might walk past some more Old Town sights on our way to the conference dinner venue.

      <li>Located right next to the Old Town, Arthur's Seat in Holyrood Park offers great views of Edinburgh.</li>
      <li>Blackford Hill is part of a lovely park that is great for walks and located just west of the campus.</li>
      <li>Craigmillar Castle is the ruins of a castle that used to be outside of Edinburgh and is now conveniently close.</li>
      <li>Edinburgh has lots of museums, many of which are free. Highlights include the National Museum of Scotland (similar to the British Museum), Surgeons' Hall (bizarre medical exposition), and the Museum of Edinburgh (history of Edinburgh).</li>
